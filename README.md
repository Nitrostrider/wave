# wave

You might notice the divs with green backgrounds in the code.  These are placeholders.  Something caused the vertical margins for the wave animations to be messed up (I suspect it to be the scaleY property).  However,it's not messed up if there's a div above it and below it in the code.

For color of the wave animation, you will have to change both the svg file and wave.css
